# Signant_assessment
Technical assessment is a simple login page which you should test with automation using Robot Framework for UI and Python for API. 
  
The demo app can be found from: https://github.com/Interview-demoapp/Flasky 
  
Basic instructions can be found from github page. Please create tests against the acceptance criteria.  
The following is needed: 
Write UI automation with Robot Framework 
Write API automation – requests with Python (we know there are RF libraries for APIs, but we want to see your Python skills) 
When using Python also write unit tests for Python implementation (=test the test code) 
Explain your approach to the implementation 
  
Other questions to answer about testing and testability, from your point of view 
How do you review code? 
How do you enforce coding standards? 
How do you plan what kind of approach you take for test automation - what libraries to use, how does it work in couple of years, how to make it easy to maintain, etc? What are the main points to consider? 
Code testability, how do you enforce it? 
How do you make sure that the product is testable? 
  
Provide the following back as redistributable git repository. 
Testing Task: 
Report of executed tests 
Report of found issues/bugs

Tell us what improvement would you propose for the app 
If you would be given a week to do quality assurance for this product, briefly plan the tasks based on your skills, knowledge and expertise 
Coding Task: 
Working stable application (Freely Distributable) of test automation implementation 
Instructions how to run it and short description of components, including external libraries 
Description about taken approach and potential gaps in application 
How much time it took, there is no time limit as such. Remember to return the task when agreed or let us know if you run late.
